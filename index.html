        <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Steve Jobs life:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Born</strong> - San Francisco, California, U.S February 24, 1955</li>

            <strong>Family</strong> - Steven Paul Jobs was born in San Francisco, California, on February 24, 1955, to Joanne Carole Schieble and Abdulfattah "John" Jandali (Arabic: عبد الفتاح الجندلي). Jandali was born in a Muslim household to wealthy Syrian parents, the youngest of nine siblings. After obtaining his undergraduate degree at the American University of Beirut, Jandali pursued a PhD in political science at the University of Wisconsin. There, he met Joanne Schieble, an American Catholic of German descent whose parents owned a mink farm and real estate. The two fell in love but faced opposition from Schieble's father due to Jandali's Muslim faith. When Schieble became pregnant, she arranged for a closed adoption, and travelled to San Francisco to give birth. 
            Schieble requested that her son be adopted by college graduates. A lawyer and his wife were selected, but they withdrew after discovering that the baby was a boy, so Jobs was instead adopted by Paul Reinhold and Clara (née Hagopian) Jobs. Paul Jobs was the son of a dairy farmer; after dropping out of high school, he worked as a mechanic, then joined the U.S. Coast Guard. When his ship was decommissioned, he met Clara Hagopian, an American of Armenian descent, and the two were engaged ten days later, in March 1946, and married that same year. The couple moved to Wisconsin, then Indiana, where Paul Jobs worked as a machinist and later as a car salesman. Since Clara missed San Francisco, she convinced Paul to move back. There, Paul worked as a repossession agent, and Clara became a bookkeeper. In 1955, after having an ectopic pregnancy, the couple looked to adopt a child. Since they lacked a college education, Schieble initially refused to sign the adoption papers, and went to court to request that her son be removed from the Jobs household and placed with a different family, but changed her mind after Paul and Clara promised to pay for their son's college tuition.

            <strong>Infancy</strong> - In his youth, Jobs' parents took him to a Lutheran church.When he was in high school, Clara admitted to his girlfriend,Chrisann Brennan, that she "was too frightened to love [Steve] for the first six months of his life … I was scared they were going to take him away from me. Even after we won the case, Steve was so difficult a child that by the time he was two I felt we had made a mistake. I wanted to return him." When Chrisann shared this comment with Steve, he stated that he was already aware, and later said he had been deeply loved and indulged by Paul and Clara. Many years later, Jobs's wife Laurene also noted that "he felt he had been really blessed by having the two of them as parents".Jobs would "bristle" when Paul and Clara were referred to as his "adoptive parents", and he regarded them as his parents  1,000%. Jobs referred to his biological parents as my sperm and egg bank. That's not harsh, it's just the way it was, a sperm bank thing, nothing more.

            "Of  all  the  inventions  of  humans,  the  computer  is  going  to  rank  near  or  at  the  top  as  history  unfolds  and  we  look  back.  It  is  the  most  awesome  tool  that  we  have  ever  invented.  I  feel  incredibly  lucky  to  be  at  exactly  the  right  place  in  Silicon  Valley,  at  exactly  the  right  time,  historically,  where  this  invention  has  taken  form."
